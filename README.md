# barebones-bazel: Master Bazel for Go microservices with this step-by-step guide.

This repository provides example code for this series of articles deep diving into building and running Go applications with Bazel, including the latest advancements introduced in Blzmod 5.0. Let's get started!

## Getting Started

Ensure you have Go (version 1.22 or higher) and Bazel installed.

## Project Structure

The repository are broken into the respective directories:

* **go-basics:** This directory houses a simple Go project with a single `main.go` file that builds a basic "Hello, Bazel!" binary using Bazel.

## Building and Running

Each Go project directory contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions. Please refer to the `README.md` within each project for guidance.
